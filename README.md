# Purpose
## A design of a platform based on Celo Blockchain focused on change how people will work, constructed for mobile.

# Goal
[A Prototype/Wireframe MVP Example For Social Impact Utilizing The Celo Platform](https://gitcoin.co/issue/29048)

# Prototypes
Prototypes are divide in two styles, the canonical and the filler. Within Figma, you can easily change them in the Flows tab.
## Canonical Prototype
### [Open prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/7x6rwgFe5h54xAvdTV2zvB/Purpose?node-id=0%3A1&viewport=69%2C229%2C0.08&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=65%3A1342&show-proto-sidebar=1)

The canonical prototype shows the main functionality of the project which is to submit a work to a contest. You can check in this [video](https://youtu.be/fHKHkB9ckA4)

On this screen path we have Edward, a user who is great at writing texts. And as he is a web3 enthusiast, he decided to submit to the Uniswap history article contest. So in this prototype you will see from the sending of the link to the receipt of the prizes.

Because the prototype has a path to follow, some screen elements are not accessible in this mode, only in the next one, which is Filler.

## Filler Prototype
### [Open prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/7x6rwgFe5h54xAvdTV2zvB/Purpose?node-id=0%3A1&viewport=69%2C229%2C0.08&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=49%3A2559&show-proto-sidebar=1)
![Screenshot_5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73398891/179368213-6cf2fa5b-b6a3-4be2-85d4-7ac8550744b5.png)

This mode is completely explorable and free. You can browse all cards, menu buttons, organizations, projects, contests, profile and among other sections of the application.

The Filler differs from Canonical by the submission and application buttons, when you press them you will see that they do not work. This separation was made due to the limitations that we have today in prototyping tools, such as Figma.

# User Experience
As requested in the issue, it was necessary to make an example prototype/wireframe for a social impact using Celo's platform.

And although the "prototype/wireframe" comes first in the issue's headline text, we need to start the project thinking first on the "social impact", thus having a real human-centered design style.
## Problem
The latest financial inclusion [report](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex) by the World Bank Group shows that 1.7 billion people are still unbanked.

So with the emergence of the internet and blockchain, these people can now have several ways to transfer their money via decentralized finance. But even though liquidity is improved for these users, they still needs to have large amounts of money (according to their local currency) to “play” within the blockchains.

That is, decentralized finance came as a great solution of how to move money easily, but not how to make money easily. So there is still a way to help not only underbanked users, but also many other types of people from different social classes who need to raise money by doing a great work.

## Solution

To change this reality, the Purpose project was created, which is a mobile-first application where organizations focused on blockchains and any type of user meet to do what they do best, work together in design, programming, writing and a lot of activities.
People at Purpose are encouraged by the prizes that web3 companies offer in contests and projects, this gives a competitive edge that is lacking in many types of tech jobs we have today.

The platform offers the user the opportunity to work and submit only having a cell phone (focused on the Writing and Social categories), which greatly increases the accessibility for people who do not have a computer to have to work. This facility will be made possible by the ultra-light client technology from Celo Blockchain that runs a full node on the cell phone.

A great reference of this model of work cited is [Layer3](https://beta.layer3.xyz/) and [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/explorer), which offers a lot of job options paid in crypto.

### Categories
To reach a wide range of users from different socioeconomic classes, submissions were divided into 4 simple categories:

* **Building:** for those who know how to program and have the ability to satisfy engineering and construction needs that various web3 protocols will require. A good understanding of smart contracts and among other blockchain knowledge is required for this category.
* **Design:** for those who understand how to design and build interfaces, graphics, prototypes, projections that organizations across blockchain need. Knowledge of design software such as Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma and others is required.
* **Writing:** for any type of person who knows how to express well and create didactic content in their speech. This category is mainly targeted at like underbanked users who may not have technical knowledge in design and programming in blockchain systems, but by reading well about organizations, they will be able to express and create text to explain different protocol bases to other people.
* **Social:** a category that involves marketing and advertising for these organizations. In-depth knowledge will not be necessary for the purpose of the contest to be achieved. Only with a good follower engagement, the user will be able to help different Web3 companies to spread their message through social networks, whether through an explanatory video on TikTok, an animated story on Instagram or a fun thread on Twitter.

### Contests
Are simply contests that organizations from all web3 can create for people to submit. Contests, as the name implies, have a competitive character, ideal for people who know how to perform tasks and gigs very well, but who do not have a good ability to convince by **speaking**, so now they can convince by **doing**.

Every organization must set for each contest:
* Deadline
* Number of prizes
* Instruction to how perform the work
* Value of prize in $CELO

### Projects
It is a much more complete type of work that needs more skill to accomplish the objective proposed by the organization, so the reward is much greater. Unlike contests, you must first be approved by the organization to submit your work.

Every organization must set for each project:
* Deadline
* Instruction to how perform the work
* Value of prize in $CELO

## Technical Statments
### Only Paid in Celo
The big difference from Purpose is that all rewards are paid in $CELO, when creating a contest or project, the organization can submit the value of the prizes normally on its own cryptocurrency, but to commit the contest or project on the platform, this value must be converted to $CELO first (MOOLA or Ubeswap API can be easily used at building).

In this way, the platform will concentrate a great deal of liquidity and guarantee a staked value to the Celo token.

### Ranking
For each contest or project approved the user earns experience on the platform too, as it is powered by Celo, we will use the rank system from the Guild.

1. Baby Bonsai
1. Wood Wide Web
1. Elden Tree
1. Lord of Wild Webs

### Submission Showing

Submission links are only shown after the deadline, to preserve the competitive spirit of the platform.
# User Interface

## [Open Figma File](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1130205945613382682)
As GitHub is not a site focused on interface visualization, for a better analysis of the screens, Figma is highly recommended, because there, in addition to being able to run the prototypes in the best quality, you can observe details. Furthermore, the design is completely open, so you can also fork the interface for any other project.
